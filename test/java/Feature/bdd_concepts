BDD is collaborative practice
Gherkin is a business readable language and it is used to write requirement or executable specification.
Executable specification act as requirement, test and documentations.
cucumber helps you to automate your executable specifications.


Tags keyword is used user to execute selective test
Background keyword is used to execute common precondition shared by multiple scenario with in the feature
Hooks keyword is used to execute the code  before or after the specific test event
These can be used setup and teardown such as intializing the data and closing the resource.
@Before, @After, @BeforeStep ,@AfterStep

configuration file is used define the various settings and behavior.you can specify plugin integration,
output format and step definition location

^ -Start of the string
$ -End of the string
(.*) - Matches anything of the String
(.+) - Matches at least one of the String
(\\d+) - Sequence of digits
(\\w+) - Sequence of letters or digits
only Hooks used for low-level logic such as starting browser, deleting data from database

Backround is used to avoid repeating the common steps in every scenario.

//To execute in cmd prompt
mvn test                        or mvn clean test   mvn clean verify
//to see results with arguments
mvn test -Dcucumber.options="--help"
//To Run Specific feature on cmd prompt
mvn test -Dcucumber.options="src/test/java/login.feature"
//To Run with tags
mvn test -Dcucumber.options="--tags @smoke"
mvn test -Dcucumber.options="-t @smoke"
//To generate test report with the execution
mvn test -Dcucumber.options="-p html:target/htmlReports"
